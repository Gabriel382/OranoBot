# Devlog — 30/12/2025

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Gabriel Henrique Alencar Medeiros, and I’m the developer behind this new project, **Orano**. I’m setting out to build a library that handles text-based prompts from a user and translates them into concrete actions on a computer. Think of it as an AI “assistant” that can see the screen, understand what’s on it, and then perform tasks—almost as if a human were clicking around.

## Context & Vision
The project is inspired by the growing capabilities of Large Language Models, such as **Claude 3.5**, which excel at processing instructions and breaking them down into actionable steps. By combining an LLM with “vision” (to perceive what’s happening on the screen) and a “bot” that ties everything together, we aim to automate day-to-day computer use in a highly flexible way.

## Goal
Ultimately, I want this project to:
1. **Benchmark different LLMs** on their ability to turn user prompts into valid, sequential computer commands.  
2. **Provide a framework** for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to experiment with advanced AI-driven automation.  
3. **Serve as a stepping stone** for future integration into MLOps pipelines, Docker-based deployments, AWS hosting, and more as the project evolves.

## Example Use-Cases
- Telling the system to **open an app**, type some text, and save a file.  
- Asking the system to **navigate a webpage**, fill out forms, and confirm that the right elements are clicked.  
- Or even more advanced tasks like **coordinating multiple apps**—all driven by a combination of LLM reasoning and screen-based feedback.

## Next Steps
I’ll use this devlog to document each phase of development. We’ve got a skeleton structure in place, and as we progress, we’ll detail:
- How the **Vision** module captures screenshots and identifies UI elements.  
- How the **Mind** module (powered by LLMs like Claude 3.5) breaks down user instructions.  
- How the **Bot** integrates everything for real-world usage.

Stay tuned—this is just the beginning of what I hope will become a powerful, open source AI automation toolkit.
